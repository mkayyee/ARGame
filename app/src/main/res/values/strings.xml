        To be able to start the level, you must first let your camera find a horizontal plane.
        This may take some time depending on the environment. The optimal environment is somewhere
        light (preferable inside), and the optimal plane has some contrast. The start level button
        will light up when a plane is found, and pressing it will begin the current level.

        that you gain access to, after using a certain amount of regular abilities that progressively fill up the ultimate bar.
